Changes:

1. call open(file_name, format): ONCE
specify name of the file and format as .csv or .xlsx

2. def antecedent(df_col, min_val = None, max_val = None, step_val = None): NEED
if there is a need, range of the input variables/functions can be altered

current ranges:
min, max, step as (max - min) / 100

current membership functions categories:
poor, average and good for all 3 variables/functions

if called like this:
status = antecedent("Status")
trend = antecedent("Trend")
peak = antecedent("Peak")

it will use default values, but if there is a need to change something
specify min, max and step value!

3. def consequent(): NEED
if there is a need, range of the output variable/function can be altered

current range => 0 to 100

4. rule_one(), rule_two(), rule_three(), rule_four(): NEED
change rule categories if there is a need

5. computation(indicator, rule): NEED
output category can be changed if needed!

current setup:
pre <= 40, acute <= 62, protracted <= 88, post <= 100
probably post will stay the same if the range stays as 0 - 100

6. ind_rule_setup() and execute_rules() function: NEED
change this only if new rules are applied!!!

7. save_file(file_name, format): ONCE
specify name of the file and format as .csv or .xlsx but only once
